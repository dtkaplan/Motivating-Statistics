## Descriptive graphics (should go in an earlier chapter.)

Here is a display constructed using the Current Population Survey wage data, `CPS85`:

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(statisticalModeling)
data(CPS85, package = "mosaicData")
gf_boxplot(wage ~ sector + color:sex, data = CPS85)
```

*** =instructions
1. Determine what mode of graphic this is, e.g. 
    - a scatterplot? `gf_point()`
    - a densityplot? `gf_density()`
    - a box-and-whiskers plot? `gf_boxplot()`
2. Read the graphic to determine which variable is playing which role: 
    - x-axis 
    - y-axis 
    - color
3. Construct a command that re-creates the graphic.

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Fill in the ..blanks..
..plot_mode_fun.. ( ..formula.. , data = CPS85)
```

*** =solution
```{r}
gf_boxplot(wage ~ sector + color:sex, data = CPS85)
```

*** =hint
- It's a box-and-whisker plot.
- `wage` is on the y-axis.
- `sector` is on the x-axis.
- `sex` is shown by color.

*** = sct
```{r}
test_function("gf_boxplot", args = c("formula", "data"), 
              not_called_msg = "It should be a box-and-whiskers plot (`gf_boxplot()`)",
              incorrect_msg = "The arguments should be a formula and `data = CPS85`.")
success_msg("")
```

## Modeling swim times I

The graphic shows a model of swim times in the `mosaicData::SwimRecords` data.

*** =instructions
1. Look at the graphic to determine which is the response variable and which are the explanatory variables.
2. Use the "shape" of the model to determine which model terms have been included.
3. Build that model.
4. Use `evaluate_model()` to get some examples of model inputs and outputs. By comparing these to the graph you can see if you built the right model.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(statisticalModeling)
library(ggplot2)
data(SwimRecords, package = "mosaicData")
.mod <- lm(time ~ sex + I(0*year), data = SwimRecords)
fmodel(.mod, ~ year + sex) + geom_point(data = SwimRecords, aes(x = year, y = time, color = sex))
```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Build the model
my_model <- lm(time ~ sex, data = SwimRecords)

# Get some examples of model inputs/outputs 
# and compare to the graph
evaluate_model(my_model)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Build the model
my_model <- lm(.___, data = SwimRecords)

# Get some examples of model inputs/outputs 
# and compare to the graph
evaluate_model(my_model)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
# Final message the student will see upon completing the exercise
success_msg("The model has just sex as an explanatory variable, which is why the lines on the graph are constant for all years.")
```

## Graphing Models with fmodel()

Given data and a model design, the computer will find the model function and model values for you.  As an example, consider the Current Population Survey  data `mosaicData::CPS85`.  Suppose you want to build a model with `wage` as a response variable and `age` and `sex` as explanatory variables incorporated as main terms.

The two arguments to `lm()` are:

1. the model design, expressed as a formula: `wage` ~ `age` + `sex`.
2. the data to be used: `data = CPS85` 

Once you have built the model, you can graph it. The plot shows one such graph.


*** =instructions
Create a graphics using `fmodel()` that depict `mod1` in each of two ways

- age on the x-axis and sex as color
- sex on the x-axis and age as color

*** =hint
The two arguments to `fmodel()` are

1. The model object itself, in this case `mod1`.
2. A formula describing which roles the explanatory variable will play in the plot, e.g. `~ age + sex` or `~ sex + age`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(statisticalModeling)
data(CPS85, package = "mosaicData")
mod1 <- lm( wage ~ 1 + age + sex, data = CPS85)
fmodel(mod1)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Construct the model
mod1 <- lm( wage ~ 1 + age + sex, data = CPS85)

# Make a graphic of mod1 with age on the x-axis and sex as color.
fmodel(mod1, ~ .___ + .___)

# Make another graphic, reversing the roles of age and sex.
fmodel(.___, .___)

```

*** =solution
# Construct the model
mod1 <- lm( wage ~ 1 + age + sex, data = CPS85)

# Make a graphic of mod1 with age on the x-axis and sex as color.
fmodel(mod1, ~ age + sex)

# Make another graphic, reversing the roles of age and sex.
fmodel(mod1, ~ sex + age)
```{r}

```

*** =sct
```{r}

# Final message the student will see upon completing the exercise
success_msg("Which graph do you find easier to interpret?")
```

## A really bad movie

Have a look at the plot that showed up in the viewer to the right. Which type of movie has the worst rating assigned to it?

*** =instructions
- Adventure
- Action
- Animation
- Comedy

*** =hint
Have a look at the plot. Which color does the point with the lowest rating have?

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# The pre exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:

# 1. Preload a dataset. The code below will read the csv that is stored at the URL's location.
# The movies variable will be available in the user's console.
movies <- read.csv("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/introduction_to_r/movies.csv")

# 2. Pre-load packages, so that users don't have to do this manually.
library(ggplot2)

# 3. Create a plot in the viewer, that students can check out while reading the exercise
ggplot(movies, aes(x = runtime, y = rating, col = genre)) + geom_point()
```

*** =sct
```{r}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# testwhat R package

msg_bad <- "That is not correct!"
msg_success <- "Exactly! There seems to be a very bad action movie in the dataset."

# Use test_mc() to grade multiple choice exercises. 
# Pass the correct option (Action, option 2 in the instructions) to correct.
# Pass the feedback messages, both positive and negative, to feedback_msgs in the appropriate order.
test_mc(correct = 2, feedback_msgs = c(msg_bad, msg_success, msg_bad, msg_bad)) 
```

## More movies

In the previous exercise, you saw a dataset about movies. In this exercise, we'll have a look at yet another dataset about movies!

A dataset with a selection of movies, `movie_selection`, is available in the workspace.

*** =instructions
- Check out the structure of `movie_selection`.
- Select movies with a rating of 5 or higher. Assign the result to `good_movies`.
- Use `plot()` to  plot `good_movies$Run` on the x-axis, `good_movies$Rating` on the y-axis and set `col` to `good_movies$Genre`.

*** =hint
- Use `str()` for the first instruction.
- For the second instruction, you should use `...[movie_selection$Rating >= 5, ]`.
- For the plot, use `plot(x = ..., y = ..., col = ...)`. 

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# Pre-load a package in the workspace
library(MindOnStats)

# You can prepare the data before the student starts:
data(Movies)
movie_selection <- Movies[Movies$Genre %in% c("action", "animated", "comedy"),c("Genre", "Rating", "Run")]

# You can also clean up data so that it's not available in the student's workspace anymore:
rm(Movies)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# movie_selection is available in your workspace

# Check out the structure of movie_selection


# Select movies that have a rating of 5 or higher: good_movies


# Plot Run (i.e. run time) on the x axis, Rating on the y axis, and set the color using Genre

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# movie_selection is available in your workspace

# Check out the structure of movie_selection
str(movie_selection)

# Select movies that have a rating of 5 or higher: good_movies
good_movies <- movie_selection[movie_selection$Rating >= 5, ]

# Plot Run (i.e. run time) on the x axis, Rating on the y axis, and set the color using Genre
plot(good_movies$Run, good_movies$Rating, col = good_movies$Genre)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# testwhat R package. Documentation can also be found at github.com/datacamp/testwhat/wiki

# Test whether the function str is called with the correct argument, object
# If it is not called, print something informative
# If it is called, but called incorrectly, print something else
test_function("str", args = "object",
              not_called_msg = "You didn't call `str()`!",
              incorrect_msg = "You didn't call `str(object = ...)` with the correct argument, `object`.")

# Test the object, good_movies
# Notice that we didn't define any feedback here, this will cause automatically 
# generated feedback to be given to the student in case of an incorrect submission
test_object("good_movies")

# Test whether the student correctly used plot()
# Again, we use the automatically generated feedback here
test_function("plot", args = "x")
test_function("plot", args = "y")
test_function("plot", args = "col")

# Alternativeley, you can use test_function() like this
# test_function("plot", args = c("x", "y", "col"))

# It's always smart to include the following line of code at the end of your SCTs
# It will check whether executing the student's code resulted in an error, 
# and if so, will cause the exercise to fail
test_error()

# Final message the student will see upon completing the exercise
success_msg("Good work!")
